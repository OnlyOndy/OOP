# CSCI 2312 – Object Oriented Programming (Spring 2024)

This repository contains my programming assignments for **CSCI 2312: Object Oriented Programming**, a course I took in Spring 2024 at the University of Colorado Denver.

## About the Course
This course focused on core concepts of object-oriented programming in C++, including:
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Dynamic memory and pointers
- Operator overloading
- File I/O
- Exception handling

## Assignments
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment completed during the semester. These assignments were designed to help us practice and apply OOP principles through hands-on coding challenges.

## Notes
The course used an automated grading system (Autograder) that relied on test files to verify functionality. However, since GitHub doesn't support this same grading setup, the test automation will not run here.

Feel free to explore the code — it's all educational!
